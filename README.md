# gacha_boombox

## Important Notes

- **Database Setup**:  
  You **need to import the SQL file** into your database. This step is crucial for the resource to work properly.
  
- **Using ESX**:  
  If you want to use **ESX** framework, you will need to **uncomment the line** in the `fxmanifest.lua` file that imports ESX. This allows the resource to interact with the ESX framework.

- **Using Items**:  
  - **If the option `useItem` is activated** in the configuration, you need to **create the item in your framework (either in the Config file or in the database)**. Once the item is created, you can use it to create a boombox.
  - **If the option `useItem` is not activated**, you can use the command `/createSpeaker` to create a boombox directly.
